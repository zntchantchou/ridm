# Riddim - Polyrhythmic Step Sequencer

## Overview

Riddim is a web-based polyrhythmic step sequencer that allows multiple rhythmic patterns with different subdivisions to run simultaneously. The application enables users to create complex, layered rhythmic structures by combining steppers with varying step counts (4, 8, 16, 32, etc.) that maintain synchronization through an intelligent pulse-based timing system.
