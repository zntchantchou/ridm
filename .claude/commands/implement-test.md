## Where to put test

Tests should live at the same level as the component they test. Write now in /src/components/[My-test].test.ts

## Check the arguments

Two arguments are expected by this command. Ask for better formulated arguments if these do not correspond to the task number and the task name, in this order.

## Preliminary step: Git

Before working implementing the task, create a branch following this format: [feature, release, fix]/$1-$2

## implementation

Follow the task created in tasks and whose name is passed to this command as an argument

## Post implementation steps

1. When a task is implemented, update the checklist in the test task's file. Include the date and time as DD-MM-YYYY-HH:mm:ss

2. If asked to commit, commit the work using the format [feature, refactor, fix]/$1-$2: [short self-explanatory commit description]
