Active step notification: 
  1. IMPLEMENTATION - DATA
   A.STEPPER CREATION:
    ✔ Create an Behaviour Subject at parent pulse creation @done(25-12-19 11:43)
    ☐ Create a subscription in Stepper at creation @started(25-12-19 11:44)
    ☐ Always unsubscribe if existing subscription at stepper subscription
    ☐ Create a subscription in Stepper at creation
      ☐ sequencer register: subscribe if there are none yet
      ☐ sequencer register: subscribe if existing
      ☐ sequencer register: subscribe if parent
      ☐ sequencer register: subscribe if child
      ☐ sequencer register: subscribe other
   B.STEPPER DELETION:
     ☐ Stepper => unsubscribe from the pulse
     ☐ if a lead pulse has no subscribers it should be deleted

   C.STEPPER UPDATE:
    ☐ Stepper subscription to pulse should be updated if needed
    ☐ If stepper is unique to pulse, pulse MUST be updated to match the stepper
  IMPLEMENTATION - SOUND:
    ☐ Make the sounds easy to lead
    ☐ each stepper must have a sound












WHAT TO USE RXJS:

  ✔ Behaviour subject : // DOES NOT SEEM NECESSARY, ONLY TRIGGER LATEST SOUND @done(25-12-19 10:53)
    - on subscribe emits the latest value
    - But the value itself has a reference to time, so its ok
  ✘ Multicasted observable @cancelled(25-12-19 10:43) // WE KNOW WE HAVE MANY SUBSCRIBERS
    - a singlecast given a subject to turn it into multicated observable
  ✘ ReplaySubject // A time in ms can be given to trigger previous executions, INTERESTING BUT NOT TO START @cancelled(25-12-19 10:48)
    - can record 
  ✘ AsyncSubject @cancelled(25-12-19 10:48)
    - delivers value once at completion
