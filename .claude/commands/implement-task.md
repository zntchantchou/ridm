## Check the arguments

Two arguments are expected by this command. Ask for better formulated arguments if these do not correspond to the task number and the task name, in this order.

## Preliminary step: Git

Before working implementing the task, create a branch following this format: [feature, release, fix]/$1-$2

## implementation

Follow the task created in tasks and whose name is passed to this command as an argument

## Post implementation steps

1. When a task is implemented, update the checklist in the task's file. Include the date and time as DD-MM-YYYY-HH:mm:ss

2. After task implementation, stop the dev server if you have launched it as part of the task implementation.
3. After task implementation, commit the work using the format [feature, refactor, fix]/$1-$2: [short self-explanatory commit description]
